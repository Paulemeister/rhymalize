[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, 1-2, 1-2
Y'all know what this is, man
Turn your fuckin' volume up
Yo, yo, ay, come on, listen
I said

[Verse 1]
Time to get creative, y'all know coffee is the drug of choice
Knockin' all them sloppy demons off me just to hush the noise
Bless my inner child, spoiled rotten with a bunch of toys
This the opposite of muscles poppin' from a ton of 'roids
Natural growth, the Mack took a oath
To leave no gaps in the practice of the raps that he wrote
Every chapter masterfully crafted, dawg, it has to be dope
His dreams, fastened to hope, schemes act as the rope
Sharp bars off the dome, throwin' darts from the melon
If the art is compelling then your heart will start swelling
Expanding with love, get high like cannabis buds
Candle lit up, I'm just hoping y'all can handle the buzz
Because admittedly, it's almost too much to take
Utilizing raw truth just to hush the fakes
We keep it authentic 'til the end of time
I send a blend of rhymes, beats bending spines

[Chorus]
It goes deep
Every time I grab the mic (grab the mic)
You probably feel this shit off in the afterlife (afterlife)
It goes deep
When I start explorin' a verse
I burn mo'fuckers like the core of the earth
Yeah, it goes deep
Every time I grab the mic (grab the mic)
You probably feel this shit off in the afterlife (afterlife)
It goes deep
When I start explorin' a verse
I burn mo'fuckers like the core of the earth
Yeah, it goes deep

[Verse 2]
I don't need motivation, all I need is a routine
To focus on creatin' instead of shiftin' to new scenes
Swifter with the verses like floor from Swiffer, they too clean
Addicted to the process of painting pictures, a true fiend
Miles David on Blue in Green, ill melodic phrasing
Caught a sensation that's hot and blazin'
While jottin' all these thought creations
If it's not authentic then I'm not relating
Pause the philosophical postulating, yo, stop debating
I'm clearly the sickest, the lyrical misfit
They feel me when they hearin' me spit
This is merely a tidbit
It goes deeper than regions over which Poseidon presidin'
In fact deeper than black holes suckin' the light in
Deeper than that addiction to the rush of excitement the drugs are providing
Deeper than the crushing depression
Deeper than rock bottom, deeper than the love that you finding
From a friend that's hugging you tight without no judgment inside him

[Chorus]
It goes deep
Every time I grab the mic (grab the mic)
You probably feel this shit off in the afterlife (afterlife)
It goes deep
When I start explorin' a verse
I burn mo'fuckers like the core of the earth
Yeah, it goes deep
Every time I grab the mic (grab the mic)
You probably feel this shit off in the afterlife (afterlife)
It goes deep
When I start explorin' a verse
I burn mo'fuckers like the core of the earth
Yeah, it goes deep

[Verse 3]
I said I'm cracking the surface, I'm rapping with purpose
Any distraction, I curve this, I’m attacking these verses
With a vengeance
So unrelenting with my craft as a wordsmith
It has to be perfect
When we in the lab and we workin’
It’s similar to pastors in churches
The passion is palpable
More than the cash that you stashin’
It's massively valuable
Molded from molten, hot, malleable materials
The incalculable power alchemy leads to miracles
This is not rap, it's a offering to God
Strip away the artificial, off with the façade
Condition critical, emcees are put up in the ER
Energy received through these bars
Effortless rhythm, entities regard
Every rhyme as heavenly
I'm forever gon' climb to the very peak
They sayin' Harry's weak, they trippin'
Make you aware of secrets that's buried deep so listen

[Chorus]
It goes deep
Every time I grab the mic (grab the mic)
You probably feel this shit off in the afterlife (afterlife)
It goes deep
When I start explorin' a verse
I burn mo'fuckers like the core of the earth
Yeah, it goes deep
Every time I grab the mic (grab the mic)
You probably feel this shit off in the afterlife (afterlife)
It goes deep
When I start explorin' a verse
I burn mo'fuckers like the core of the earth
Yeah, it goes deep
